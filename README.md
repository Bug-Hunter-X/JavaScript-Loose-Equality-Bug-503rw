# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) and type coercion.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers. However, its use of `==` to check for `null` or `undefined` values leads to incorrect results in certain cases.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type conversions which can compromise the accuracy and reliability of the code.
